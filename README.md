Word Zilla is based on the popular word-guessing game Wordle. Players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word. Each guess must be a valid English word, and after each attempt, the game provides feedback by color-coding letters based on their correctness. The goal is to deduce the hidden word using logic and deduction within the given attempts.
## Instructions:

5.	Continue adjusting your guesses until you either correctly guess the word or use all six attempts.
